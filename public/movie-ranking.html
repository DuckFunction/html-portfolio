        <h3>Hot Fuzz</h3>
            <p>Second movie of the 3 flavors of cornetto triology, it features Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. I love the humor and how ridiculous it gets.</p>
        <h3>Spiderman: Into the spiderverse</h3>
            <p>It features multiple different arts styles and mimics the style of comic books at the same time.</p>
        <h3>Smosh: The Movie</h3>
        <p>This is far from my favorite; I just can't think of anything else.</p>
